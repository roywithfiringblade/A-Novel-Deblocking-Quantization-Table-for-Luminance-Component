# A-Novel-Deblocking-Quantization-Table-for-Luminance-Component
## introduction
A final project for TUM master course: [EI50291] Image and Video Compression Lab

A matlab implementation of the paper: “A Novel Deblocking Quantization Table for Luminance Component in Baseline JPEG”[link](http://www.jocm.us/uploadfile/2015/0824/20150824112248702.pdf).

The paper works on the relation between APBT-JPEG and DCT-JPEG. In order to avoid extra computational complexity in APBT-JPEG, a novel quantization table is proposed to be used in DCT-JPEG and an almost identical coding performance is achieved compared with APBT-JPEG. The experiment of the paper is only implemented on still images. In this final optimization project, we reproduce the result with the given “foreman” image set and also implement that on video compression task. And the conclusion from the paper is verified.
